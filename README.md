# TWICT-Prompt-Engineering-Introduction-Workshop

## About

Malo e Lelei and welcome! I'm excited to lead this groundbreaking 1st Prompt Engineering Introductory Workshop powered by AI for Tongan Nationals, hosted by the pioneering Tongan Women in ICT (TWICT).

This workshop aims to provide an introduction to the emerging field of prompt engineering and equip attendees with the skills to effectively interact with generative AI models using natural language prompts.

In this hands-on session, you'll learn:

What prompt engineering is and why it's important Best practices for crafting clear and effective prompts. Different types of prompting techniques (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought). Strategies for iterating and refining prompts Hands-on experience developing prompts for various use cases

By the end of the workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of prompt engineering fundamentals and be able to start exploring ways to leverage generative AI capabilities in your work or projects.

This repository contains the workshop slides, exercises, and additional resources to supplement the learning experience. Whether you're a technologist, policymaker, student or just someone curious about AI, this workshop will help you gain literacy in the art of prompting language models.

As our communities navigate the rise of generative AI, prompt engineering skills will be crucial for ethical, equitable and culturally-grounded development of these powerful technologies. Let's come together to shape the AI tools that can uplift our narratives and amplify our voices.

So join us and be part of the revolution - an AI-powered future that is Pasifika-led!
